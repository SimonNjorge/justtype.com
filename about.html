            justtype.com is a touch typing practising website.
            One may ask, what is touch typing? Well, touch typing just means
            typing on a keyboard without looking at the keys. This skill can only
            be achieved by continuous practice to equip your fingers with muscle memory 
            so that they can navigate through the desired keys seamlessly without hunt and peck
            which involves visually searching for each key on the keyboard before pressing it down.
            This   results in slower typing speeds and increased errors compared to touch typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Random words (not real words) are generated using a specific set of letters on the keyboard.
            When the user is able to type the latter words with a speed  of 25WPM with over 70% accuracy new letters are 
            added to the set and the cycle continues until the all the keyboard letters are covered.   
        </p>
        <p>
            After every session, the speed in words per minute(WPM) is displayed. Each word is assumed to have an average of five characters.
            The speed is  normalised to the number of words that the user would type in one minute depending on the selected session duration.
            Also displayed together with the speed is  the accuracy, which is a percentage of the correctly typed letters out of the total characters
            typed in a session.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can take speed tests after practising. The speed tests use common english words that are rendered interchangeably in different tests.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <p>Things to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking on the website while in mid-session will make the letters loose Keyboard focus.
                To continue with the session when this happens, click on the letter on which you were to restore focus and
                continue with the session.
            </li>
            <li>
                 While using this site avoid restarting using the Enter key while in mid-session. Note that this will cause an error while typing the first 
           letter of the rendered words on that restart. Besides that, everything else works normally no matter the kind of  user interaction with the keys.
            </li>
        </ul>
